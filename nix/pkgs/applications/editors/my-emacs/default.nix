## Generate a wrapped emacs with all required libraries and executables in the
## path
##
## "all" here means, anything required by the configuration generated by the
## emacs-config derivation in this monorepo
##
## Since some packages carry some heavy dependencies with them, you can
## denylist them if you need to generate an emacs but don't want to spend the
## time on waiting for a plethora of things to download (check emacs-config.nix)
